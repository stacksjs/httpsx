``` -->

> [!NOTE]
> We are trying to release under the `httx` package name, which is currently abandoned. Please @npmjs, we would love to!🙏🏽

## Get Started

Making requests is simple. There are two ways of getting started: _as a library or as a CLI._

### Library

Given the npm package is installed:

```ts
import type { HttxConfig } from 'httx'
// import { ... } from 'httx'

// ...
```

In case you are trying to start multiple proxies, you may use this configuration:

### CLI

```bash
httx get api.example.com/users
httx post api.example.com/users name=john email=john@example.com -j
httx get api.example.com/files file@./data.txt -m
httx get api.example.com/secure -a username:password

httx --help
httx --version
```

## Configuration

The Reverse Proxy can be configured using a `httx.config.ts` _(or `httx.config.js`)_ file and it will be automatically loaded when running the `reverse-proxy` command.

```ts
// httx.config.{ts,js}
import type { HttxOptions } from '@stacksjs/httx'
import os from 'node:os'
import path from 'node:path'

const config: HttxOptions = {
  verbose: false,
}

export default config
```

_Then run:_

```bash
./httx
```
