# httpsx

> httpsx is a simple, lightweight and user-friendly API client.

## Features

-

## Install

```bash
bun install -d httpsx
```

<!-- _Alternatively, you can install:_

```bash
brew install httpsx # wip
pkgx install httpsx # wip
``` -->

## Get Started

Making requests is simple. There are two ways of getting started: _as a library or as a CLI._

### Library

Given the npm package is installed:

```ts
import type { HttpsxConfig } from 'httpsx'
import { ... } from 'httpsx'

// ...
```

In case you are trying to start multiple proxies, you may use this configuration:

### CLI

```bash
httpsx ...
httpsx --help
httpsx --version
```

## Configuration

The Reverse Proxy can be configured using a `httpsx.config.ts` _(or `httpsx.config.js`)_ file and it will be automatically loaded when running the `reverse-proxy` command.

```ts
// httpsx.config.{ts,js}
import type { HttpsxOptions } from '@stacksjs/httpsx'
import os from 'node:os'
import path from 'node:path'

const config: HttpsxOptions = {
  verbose: false,
}

export default config
```

_Then run:_

```bash
./httpsx
```
